        <p class="aboot-blurb">Hi! I'm Oli. I like Futurama, rap music, video games, and <span style="font-family: funkyFont; color: #00ff3c">funky</span> stuff in general.</p>

            <p>I love Futurama! It's one of the wittiest cartoons I have ever seen and Zoidberg is possibly the funniest cartoon character to ever exist. I've watched it about 7 times over and I WILL nerd out about it constantly.</p>
            <p>I like to think my music taste is quite nice, although others may disagree. I listen to a lot of old-school rap and hip-hop, from the likes of Eminem, Dr. Dre, Biggie, Beastie Boys, and Run-DMC (just to name a few). I also write some stuff myself, but I haven't yet produced an actual song.</p>
            <p>I LOVE LOVE LOVE computers and technology. My brain is very logic-oriented, so it's very easy for me to understand how things work with machines and code. I've made a few fun projects such as this website (self-referential :D), a handheld console that plays Pong, and a multimeter. More about these things can be found on my blog (if I get around to it lol)</p>
            <p>Video games are a big part of my life. I absolutely adore retro games for their simplicity and the pure enjoyment I get from them. I also like car-racing games, Deep Rock Galactic, Minecraft, and Team Fortress 2. I'm a big fan of Valve and Steam and what they've done with gaming. I have a Steam Deck, a GBA SP, and an SNES, in addition to my PC.</p>

                <p>I love Futurama! It's one of the wittiest cartoons I have ever seen and Zoidberg is possibly the funniest cartoon character to ever exist. I've watched it about 7 times over and I WILL nerd out about it constantly. I wear a red jacket every day, just like Fry, and I have a Slurm hat signed by Billy West, one of the voice actors in the show!</p>

                <h2>Music is Funky</h2>
                <p>I like to think my music taste is quite nice, although others may disagree. I listen to a lot of old-school rap and hip-hop, from the likes of Eminem, Dr. Dre, Biggie, Beastie Boys, and Run-DMC (just to name a few). I also write some stuff myself, but I haven't yet produced an actual song. My friend got me into some indie rock and it's very nice. It's easier to listen to than rap when studying or focusing because I don't listen to the words so much as to the nice music.</p>
